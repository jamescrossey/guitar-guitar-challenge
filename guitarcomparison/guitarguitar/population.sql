Inspired by Brian May's legendary Red Special, an instrument that has achieved iconic status and its own unique place in rock history, the BMG Special is a stunning guitar, blessed with superb build quality, awesome playability and an astonishingly rich diversity of killer tones.

\n
In fact it delivers everything you'd expect from an instrument built to the exacting standards of one of the world's greatest musicians but, in keeping with Brian's vision of a \"guitar for the people\", with an amazingly affordable price-tag that belies its superior appointments and performance.

\n
Without question one of the most eagerly anticipated instruments of the century, the original House Music helmed, Burns branded Brian May Signature was unleashed in the winter of 2001 to rapturous critical and public acclaim. UK \"Guitar Bible\", Guitarist Magazine hailed it as \"Best Guitar Of The Year\" and theatre audiences around the globe thrilled to the guitar's sound in performance in the hit Queen musical \"We Will Rock You\".

\n
But the story certainly didn't end there.

\n
Teaming up with the maestro and his long-standing guitar technician, Pete Malandrone, House Music established Brian May Guitars in 2004 with the launch of an all-new \"Special\". With production re-located to one of the world's most respected instrument manufacturing facilities, the BMG Special featured significant improvements in design, specification and construction. Subsequent iterations - released in 2006, 2012 and 2017 - have seen further upgrades and refinements to the Special's bridge assembly, pickups, electronics, hardware, finishing and colour choices.

\n
Simply put, the world's best artist designed production guitar has consistently got a whole lot better.

\n
The BMG Special is an immensely versatile, pro-grade instrument designed not just to replicate the unique sound of one of rock 'n' roll's true heroes, but also to provide modern musicians of all musical persuasions with the perfect go-to guitar for any performance environment.

The Fender® American Vintage II series presents a remarkably accurate take on \r\nthe revolutionary designs that altered the course of musical history. Built with \r\nperiod-accurate bodies, necks and hardware, premium finishes and meticulously \r\nvoiced, year-specific pickups, each instrument captures the essence of authentic \r\nFender craftsmanship and tone.

\r\n
During the late ‘50s and early ‘60s, the popularity of Fender musical \r\ninstruments flourished, and although the Fender assortment had expanded to \r\ninclude many great new instruments, the Stratocaster® reigned supreme. By 1961, \r\nthe Stratocaster had taken on a more refined aesthetic, with a 3-Color Sunburst \r\nreformulated with a more vibrant red and bolder black edge, topped with a 3-ply \r\npickguard accenting the Strat’s signature curves.

\r\n
Featuring a premium alder body, a trio of Pure Vintage 1961 Stratocaster \r\npickups and a medium “C”-Shaped maple neck mated with a 7.25” radius slab \r\nrosewood fingerboard, the American Vintage II 1961 Stratocaster reproduces the \r\nquintessential tone and feel of the original. Other appointments include a \r\nvintage-accurate synchronized tremolo with cold rolled steel block and bent \r\nsteel saddles, single-line “Fender Deluxe” tuners and 3-ply pickguard.

\r\n
The instruments in the American Vintage II series are direct descendants of \r\nthe original Fenders: designed for players with a fine appreciation for vintage \r\nFender tone and feel and built with unmatched quality, down to the last screw. \r\nThese are Fender electrics in their purest form: Fender American Vintage II, the \r\nstuff of legends.

Honoring the electrifying “Voodoo Chile” who popularized the Stratocaster guitar and its tremendous sonic flexibility, the Jimi Hendrix Stratocaster gives you the same fiery tone and playing feel to wield as your own. Full of incendiary vintage tone and classic style, this extraordinary instrument features signature touches and unique appointments based on his distinctive “flipped-over” guitars.

\r\n\r\n
The foundation of Hendrix’s uniquely personal sound and playing style was his habit of flipping his guitars over and restringing them to accommodate his left-handed playing, resulting in a “reverse” headstock and bridge pickup—features reproduced here in exacting detail. The “reverse” headstock produces a longer string length for the bass strings, creating a tighter playing feel along with easier bending and vibrato on the treble strings. A trio of unsurpassed American Vintage ’65 single-coil pickups includes a reverse-slant bridge pickup, producing uniquely inspiring tone with tight, warm sound and enhanced upper harmonics and definition. The highly versatile 9.5”-radius “C”-shaped maple neck with medium jumbo frets offers a flatter playing surface—ideal for chording while simultaneously allowing you to bend notes to the stratosphere during scorching solos.

\r\n\r\n
Commemorating Hendrix’s unrivaled legacy, the large ’70s-style headstock \r\nbears the guitarist’s signature on the rear. A unique neck plate displays a \r\nshoulders-up silhouette of the man himself and the engraved inscription, \r\n“Authentic Hendrix,” leaving no doubt as to the inspiration behind this guitar.

The SE Mark Holcomb model truly stands on its own in the PRS lineup and delivers addictive playability thanks to some unique specifications, including a 24-fret, 25.5” scale length wide thin satin maple neck with 20” radius ebony fretboard. Holcomb’s signature pickups provide the right amount of output and articulation whether you’re playing sophisticated chords or solos and whether you’re playing alone or working in the mix of a band. Other specifications include a quilted maple veneer, black chrome hardware, and a 3-way blade pickup switch with push/pull tone knob for coil splitting.

It’s time to rethink what an acoustic-electric guitar can do. Do you want to play leads all the way up the neck? Do you want to play longer? Play louder? Now you can with the SC-13E, a super-comfortable, easy-to-play acoustic-electric from Martin.

\n
The first thing you’ll notice is the revolutionary new cutaway. With the patent-pending Sure AlignTM neck system, Martin utilised a heel-less design, providing full access to all 20 frets.

\n
If all that access isn’t enough, the asymmetrical body provides balanced output, so you get more gain before feedback. 

\n
The SC-13E is a performing guitarist’s dream. It is equipped with a new, low-profile velocity neck that ergonomically accommodates your hand, giving it the comfort and playability of an electric.

\n
While the SC-13E is designed to be plugged in, don’t be fooled—it’s still a Martin—so it sounds amazing unplugged. Whether you are on stage, in the studio, or just strumming at home, the SC-13E removes the restrictions of the conventional acoustic-electric guitar.  

\n
The SC-13E is constructed with a spruce top and a koa fine veneer back and sides, all with a beautiful gloss finish. Its low-profile velocity, ergonomic neck is carved to produce a subtle progressive taper for maximum comfort, while blue accents in the rosette, fingerboard, and binding are sure to make this guitar stand out in a crowd. It is equipped with a built-in tuner, discreetly tucked inside the soundhole so you can make adjustments without missing a beat. And to further delight performing artists, the SC-13E comes with a soft-shell case and is strung with Martin’s Authentic Acoustic Lifespan® 2.0 strings.

\r\n\r\n
Actuator
An actuator is installed on the inner surface of the guitar back vibrates in response to the vibrations of the strings. The vibrations of the actuator are then conveyed to the body of the guitar and to the air in and around the guitar body, generating authentic reverb and chorus sounds from inside the body.

\r\n
Simple Controls
Three simple knobs let you adjust the degree of effect applied and the line-out volume level. Additionally, keeping the controls small minimizes the area of the holes in the body material, reducing acoustic sound loss

\r\n
New Battery Box
The battery box is integrated into the end-pin jack. This requires fewer holes in the body, thus reducing acoustic sound loss. Connect the cable from the jack to a PA or amp to use as an Electro-Acoustic Guitar.

\r\n
Designed to Provide Superb Acoustic Guitar Sound
The body is an all-solid guitar based on the L-series. A modified non-scalloped bracing design enhances the low end with retaining the bright tone. Treating the tops with Yamaha’s exclusive A.R.E. process gives the instrument a rich, vintage quality tone.

New bracing pattern, thinner bridge plate
\n
The new CG series features a new bracing pattern that delivers excellent response and rich resonance. These guitars also feature a bridge plate that efficiently transfers string vibration to the guitar top.

Cedar Top
\n
Bright, warm tone. Excellent response with relatively thick treble. Cedar offers a mature tone with little change over time, providing a high level of perfection.

Stable Neck Condition
\n
Necks utilize a strong 3-ply laminate design that resists warping and twisting. This design improves neck strength, offers greater stability against shape changes over time, and allows lower string height. In addition to providing greater neck stability, the laminated design also makes effective use of resources.

\n
The matte finish on the back of the neck allows the left hand to move smoothly while also providing a secure grip. The finish is applied with a thin coat that contributes to improved resonance. The same matte finish is applied to the bridge for improved resonance.

The AEG50 starts with a new preamp, an Ibanez AEQ-TTS. The small and simple preamp has only two control knobs, volume and shape. This at-a-glance tone control offers natural acoustic sound in the center position. It allows players to adjust the tone easily and enables them to go from low, fat and powerful tones to a bright and crispy sound while adjusting only one knob. A new easy-to-read onboard tuner with LCD(liquid crystal display) is located on the preamp.

The AEG50 comes with a simplified rosette, a binding and ornamentation on the headstock. These finer details add a sharp and stylish atomosphere to the guitar.

Other features include a Spruce top and a Sapele back & sides body, an Ibanez T-bar II Undersaddle pickup which equalizes the volume from each string and delivers a well-balanced signal, and special bulb-shaped Ibanez Advantage Bridge pins for easy string installation.

\n
Special Bracing
Yamaha's FS guitars have a louder and stronger sound in the low-to-mid ranges, thanks to cutting-edge acoustic analysis technology developed by the Yamaha R&D Division. Yamaha’s engineers have achieved this sound by utilizing analysis and simulation to arrive at the best bracing design without depending on tradition or guesswork. This analysis led to the development of the new scalloped bracing pattern, a new and ideal acoustic structure that maintains the durability of the top board while bringing out the most sound the Yamaha FS has to offer.

\n
Thinner body
The FS model body is 10mm slimmer than that of the FG body, offering increased comfort and playability with no loss of volume or bass. Having a body that is easier to hold makes the FS more appealing to beginners and smaller guitarists, including female players. In addition, the smaller dimensions and lower propensity to feedback make FS guitars ideal for stage use.

\n
System 66 Electronics
System 66 feature an under-saddle piezo pickup developed by Yamaha. Controls include a 3-band EQ, an adjustable mid-range frequency control, and a precision chromatic tuner for optimum sound tailoring. The system is powered by easy to obtain AA-size batteries that provide a stable power supply for improved sound quality.

The ACS blends classical guitar concepts with elements of solid body design. The incredibly comfortable neck of the Multiac ACS, combined with a Maple body & Cedar top, contribute to making it our most affordable synth access guitar ever. Although the body is chambered, the response from the cedar top is more typical of a solid body design than a traditional acoustic guitar. This design results in an instrument that is virtually free of feedback, making it easy to use even when the band gets loud.

\r\n\r\n

Among the first Taylor models to be voiced with our patented V-Class™ bracing, this beautiful all-koa Grand Auditorium K24ce acoustic guitar will inspire players in both looks and sound. The hardwood koa top helps produce a balanced response across the tonal spectrum, with a clear, focused voice that lends itself to amplification through our onboard ES2 electronics. With the V-Class treatment, players can expect more dynamic range, more sustain, and notes that sound more in tune with each other than ever before, giving chords a more sonically pleasing character along the entire fretboard. Together with our popular Grand Auditorium body, the musical versatility makes this a guitar that can cover a lot of ground. Visually, koa’s shimmering figure is highlighted with organically styled appointments that include our new Spring Vine inlay in maple, with maple binding and top trim adding a creamy counterpoint against the shaded edgeburst finish that surrounds the entire guitar.

Featuring a never-before-used tonewood and a host of player-focused design enhancements, the Builder’s Edition 324ce represents Taylor’s ongoing marriage of innovative acoustic design with forward-thinking strategy toward a more sustainable future. The star here is Urban Ash™, a tonewood sourced from salvaged city trees that have been selected for removal from urban settings due to due to weather or disease damage, public safety concerns, disruptive root systems, and simply reaching the end of their life cycle. Instead of allowing this beautiful, functional wood to end its life cycle in a landfill, \r\nTaylor have reclaimed it for use in the backs and sides of this 324ce, offering a tonal response similar to high-tier mahogany: dry and woody, with a fundamental-strong response that produces clear notes largely free from ringing overtones.

\r\n
Paired with a mahogany top, this Grand Auditorium produces clear midrange presence and crisp highs over a rich low end that will satisfy strummers and fingerstyle players alike. V-Class bracing offers its trademark blend of power and resonance, emphasizing this guitar’s robust midrange while producing a more in-tune, musical sound. In keeping with the Builder’s Edition philosophy, this 324ce features an array of enhancements designed to provide the ultimate playing experience, including chamfered body and fretboard edges, a beveled armrest and cutaway, and a Curve Wing bridge. Other appointments include Compass inlays in faux pearl and Italian acrylic, Gotoh 510 tuners with a super-precise 21:1 gear ratio, a Silent Satin finish with a dark edgeburst treatment for an ultra-clean, noise-free sound, and ES2 electronics. It ships in a deluxe Western Floral hardshell case.

The 30”-scale 4-string bass is downsized enough to be comfortable to play while still providing a good focused tone that will work in virtually any playing context.

For more than 40 years, Ibanez has pioneered new frontiers in bass development, pushing the boundaries of conventional designs to bass players of all styles and aptitude new ways of expressing themselves. This spirit of exploration has led to the creation of some of the most successful and popular production basses of all time. Utilizing experience and knowledge up until now, Ibanez has developed ultimate ergonomic basses, the EHB basses, which feature the deeply considered headless design.

\r\n
The EHB’s headless construction and specially designed body enable the player to maintain a similar playing position whether seated or standing. Its contoured, ergonomic design and chambered body make for a lightweight, well-balanced, and comfortable instrument that’s excellent for long sets or practice session. There is extra carving on the back of the body behind the lower horn for easier upper fret access. Also, the top half of the back of the body is slanted which allows the bass to rest slight closer to the player’s body for better control and a more ergonomic feel.

\r\n
The EHB1005MS features an American Basswood body and the 5-piece roasted Maple/Walnut neck for well-balanced tone and clear attack. The Roasted Maple in the neck is heat-treated to increase stability, durability, moisture resistance, and tolerance of temperature changes. The Roasted Maple fretboard is also heat-treated for a balanced attack and rich sustain. Highly durable stainless steel frets accentuate tonal brightness and will not rust. Luminescent side dot inlays provide clear visibility in dark environments and the truss rod adjustment is located at the end of neck for easy access. With its multi-scale design, the EHB1005MS creates an \"alive\" open tone and is comfortable to play. The ergonomic construction coordinates with the player's hand angle as it moves up and down the neck, facilitating a quick, smooth, playing action.

Cort helped pioneer the headless guitar and bass revolution in the 1980’s with the Space line of headless guitars and basses with tuners licensed by Steinberger Sound. This concept is now being reintroduced and the Space 5 has been developed to commemorate Cort’s innovative and revolutionary spirit and to meet the growing demand and interest in compact headless design instruments.

\r\n
Maple Body with Poplar Burl Top

\r\n
The combination of the ash top on the mahogany body ensures a great balance
between warm yet full sounding lows and bright and transparent highs, not to
mention beautiful wood grain of the ash top for a more natural organic aesthetic.

\r\n
New Space Body Shape

\r\n
Inspired by the original Space basses from the 1980s, the Space 5 is the modern adaptation of the 80’s classic, with body and neck modeled after the modern flagship Artisan Bass Series with modifications to make it more compact (deeper and bolder contour and cutaways) and headless (individual bridge with tuner knobs).

\r\n
Bartolini® MK-1 Pickupsand Active 3-band EQ Preamp 

\r\n
The trademark Bartolini sound is preserved in the MK-1 while providing superb sound quality and value. The MK-1 delivers plenty of punchy and warm mids along with transparent and
brilliant highs for a superbly balanced sound. The accompanying active 3-band EQ preamp enables players to equalize and fine tune the perfect tone with its low, mid, and high frequency adjustment knobs.

\r\n
'Next Gen' Cort Logo

\r\n
The modern and sleek design of the ‘Next Gen’ Cort logo is engraved on the body of the Space 5.

\r\n
Specially Designed Hardware for Headless System

\r\n
Head piece and individual bridges were carefully developed and rigorously tested to ensure maximum tuning and playing stability, as well as keeping the Space 5 as light, compact, and hassle-free as possible.

\r\n
7pcs Rosted maple, Walnut, Purple heart & maple Neck

\r\n
The emphasis of the Panga Panga and Walnut combination is on tight and defined midrange that complements the bright and expansive tonal nature of the Mahogany body for an ideally
balanced sound to round out the bass spectrum.

\r\n
Zero Fret

\r\n
The zero fret does the job of the bass nut by setting the string height over the fretboard when being played open. The nut is still used as a guide to set the string spacing before going to the tuners. Since the nut is not responsible for the open notes, players can change to any string gauge without worrying about resizing or replacing the nut, and be free from any unwanted friction between the nut and the strings.

\r\n
Spoke Nut Hotrod Truss Rod

\r\n
The spoke nut truss rod adjustment feature allows the player to dial in the exact amount of neck bow depending on the player’s technique and playing style.

The Fender® American Vintage II series presents a remarkably accurate take on the revolutionary designs that altered the course of musical history. Built with period-accurate bodies, necks and hardware, premium finishes and meticulously voiced, year-specific pickups, each instrument captures the essence of authentic Fender craftsmanship and tone.

\n
The late '50s to the early '60s was a watershed period in the development of the Precision Bass®, a time of transition that would see the introduction of many new appointments that would become synonymous with the P-Bass®. By 1960, the design of the P-bass had eclipsed the earlier cues culled from the Telecaster® - now the P-bass had a Strat®-style headstock shape, comfort-contours, pickguard mounted electronics and 4-saddle bridge. Adorned in 3-Color Sunburst and topped with a 4-ply tortoiseshell pickguard, the 1960 Precision Bass represented a more refined, enduring aesthetic for the model.

\n
Featuring a premium alder body, Pure Vintage '60 Split-Coil P-Bass pickup and a substantial \"\"C\"\" shape hard rock maple neck mated with a 7.25\"\" radius slab rosewood fingerboard, the American Vintage II 1960 Precision Bass reproduces the quintessential tone and feel of the original.

\n
The instruments in the American Vintage II series are direct descendants of the original Fenders: designed for players with a fine appreciation for vintage Fender tone and feel and built with unmatched quality, down to the last screw. These are Fender electrics in their purest form: Fender American Vintage II, the stuff of legends.

The debut of the Precision Bass in 1951 is arguably one of the most important milestones of the 20th Century. The P Bass® gave bass players a means to be heard clearly while eliminating the need to lug around a heavy (and fragile) upright bass. It also profoundly changed the sound of popular music and gave birth to a slew of new musical styles. The Vintage Custom 1951 Precision Bass offers the appointments that made the original the undisputed champion of working bassists the world over, including a supremely fast and comfortable tinted quartersawn maple neck with a 7.25\" fingerboard radius, '51-‘55 P Bass bridge with vintage fiber bridge saddles and flatwound strings. It also boasts an original slab-style P Bass body with a NOS flash-coat lacquer finish that lets the instrument breathe more organically and shows some of the natural grain through the finish.

\r\n\r\n
Other features of the Vintage Custom 1951 Precision Bass include Closet Classic hardware, a 2-piece ash body, 20 vintage frets, '55 P Bass pickup, volume and tone controls, single-ply black pickguard, bone nut, round string retainer and vintage-style tuning machines.

\r\n\r\n
A living legend, this Precision Bass sounds just as good now as the original did back in 1951. Includes a deluxe hardshell case, strap and Certificate of Authenticity.

Players fond of the old adage “if it ain’t broke…” haven’t played a JB-2™. You see, the G&L JB-2 is all about refinement, blending “holy grail” Alnico single-coil tone with modern Leo Fender improvements.

\n
The JB-2’s classic Alnico V pickups have tone reminiscent of the best examples from the early ‘60s, thanks to the work of Paul Gagon, G&L VP Engineering. Gagon found his inspiration reviewing original prints stored in Leo Fender’s private laboratory at G&L, but that was just the start. About 30 years ago, Gagon was an R&D; engineer at another company when he was tasked with finding out what was so special about the early bolt-on basses many players raved about. Gagon tirelessly analyzed many examples of what were considered holy grail basses, spending time out on the shop floor talking to builders still working in the pickup department since the ‘50s, all on a quest to discover where the real mojo was – and wasn’t. What he learned from the builders matched his own engineering analysis. You see, back in the day, the actual spec of pickups coming down that old production line varied considerably. That meant coming up with the right specs was more challenging than simply following the prints, and Gagon’s persistence paid off as the JB-2 serves up delicious, classic tone.

\n
While the pickups are the origin of the tone, the JB-2 will surprise you with a clarity and sustain unmatched by old basses with their rudimentary bridge design. You see, the JB-2 features an innovative G&L Saddle-Lock™ bridge to transfer string energy right into the body end-grain for an incredibly resonant instrument. If you’re ready to let go of the past but still love that classic Alnico tone, get your hands on a JB-2 and experience a brilliant mash-up of old-school and new-school Leo. Once you play a G&L Tribute Series, you’ll never look back.

The verdict became clear so fast it would have put that wry grin on Leo’s face: the Made-in-Fullerton Kiloton is a smash-hit. Demand from players and musicians alike for a Tribute® Series version thundered with the same visceral punch as the bass itself delivers. And the moment of impact is now: meet the new G&L® Tribute Series Kiloton.

\n
Just like its Made-in-Fullerton brother, the Tribute Series Kiloton features the most comfortable bass body ever created by Leo Fender. It’s compact and pure, with every curve and contour perfectly executed. The Tribute Series Kiloton delivers maximum firepower from its single G&L Magnetic Field Design humbucker, planted right in the sweet spot specified by Leo Fender back when the G&L factory was still called CLF Research.

\n
The Tribute Series Kiloton’s single Made-in-Fullerton MFD ‘bucker fires without the aid of a preamp, while a 3-position series/split/parallel toggle harnesses the coils’ power. Simple volume and tone controls are devastatingly effective, revealing a wide range of textures Leo’s MFD bucker is famous for. What’s more, the Tribute Series Kiloton is armed with a Leo Fender-designed Saddle-Lock bridge to transfer all the energy right into the body end-grain for an incredibly resonant instrument.

The G&L LB-100 made its debut in the early '90s ago in response to bassists asking for more subtle evolution of the p-style platform, as compared to the SB-1 and L-1000.

The OCD has received many slight tweaks since its birth \r\nin 2004, often incorrectly identified as “version 2, Version 3, Version 4.” In \r\nreality there has always been only one version…Version 1, with very slight \r\nvariations in a couple of values after that making them V1.0 through V1.8. All \r\nOCDs serial 205811 and higher are the new, less compressed versions some refer \r\nto as \"v2.01\"

\r\n
\r\nWhat's stayed the same - The OCD was the \r\nfirst pedal to use Mosfets as clipping devices. Another first was their \r\nconfiguration as \"hard clippers connected to v-ref\" instead of to ground, as was \r\nthe norm. These things contribute greatly as to why the OCD has such \r\ntouch-sensitivity...why they react so well when the strings are hit hard or \r\nsoft, and why they sound & feel different than all other pedals out there, 90% \r\nof which are just slight tweaks of the Tube Screamer.

\r\n
\r\nNEW FEATURE output \r\nbuffer (when pedal is turned on in \r\nTrue-Bypass mode, or always when in Enhanced Bypass mode) which eliminates it \r\nfrom being influenced by effects that came after it. Translation, your sound \r\nremains consistent regardless of placement in today’s more complex \r\nsignal-chains, loopers, and pedalboards. This buffer also had a positive effect \r\non the sound, it reduced loading on the pedal’s hard-clipping stage, allowing \r\nmore sustain of both the sound and the overtones.

\r\n
\r\nNEW FEATURE Class \r\nA configured discrete 2N5457 JFET input section, raising the input \r\nimpedance to 1 mega ohms (previously 330K) and increasing the dynamics…resulting \r\nin significantly better interaction with both single coil and humbuckers.

For tone purists, the StroboStomp HD provides a 100% silent, true-bypass \r\noperation mode to keep precious tone safe, as well as eliminate the often \r\nannoying “pop” experienced when engaging such a feature in other products. It \r\nuses a unique series of timed relays incorporated within its circuitry to shunt \r\nthe signal, draining the cause of the popping sound prior to breaking the \r\nconnection, and effectively shutting the tuner down for direct play through \r\nwithout affecting tone quality.

\r\n
The StroboStomp HD also includes a long-time, user-requested buffered output \r\noperation mode that can be user engaged. The buffered mode can be used in or out \r\nof monitor mode. It is designed to boost instrument drive to overcome potential \r\ntone loss in signal chains that incorporate multiple low-impedance guitar pedals \r\nor those that utilize long cable runs. The buffered output modes preserve sonic \r\nquality all through the instrument range and keep prized core tone intact.

\r\n
The StroboStomp HD features over 100 exclusive Sweetened Tunings™ as well as \r\nnumbered guided tuning presets for a large variety of instruments and playing \r\nstyles. Sweetened Tunings are exclusive to Peterson tuning products and are \r\ndesigned to help correct inherent tuning issues exhibited by many instruments. \r\nThe new \"Guided Tunings\" mode allows the StroboStomp HD to display numeric \r\nstring values instead of traditional note names making for sure-fire intuitive \r\nand rapid re-tuning to any number of open and alternative tunings. The Guided \r\nTuning mode was instituted for beginners who want to experiment with popular \r\nalternate tunings in addition to experienced players who employ multiple tunings \r\nin rapid succession. Numerically expressed scales are also included.

MXR knows phasers. The Phase 90's compact size, superior construction, and refined sound put MXR on the map, and it set the standard by which all other phasers are judged. Two years later, MXR released the Phase 45 - a mellower version of the effect favored for its ability to easily blend into a band's mix. Now, you can get both iconic circuits in a single pedal while tightening up your pedalboard at the same time. The Phase 95 combines the Phase 45 and Phase 90 circuits in a mini housing with about half the footprint of a standard MXR pedal. The 45/90 switch toggles between the Phase 45 mode's subtle two-stage phasing and the Phase 90 mode's more pronounced four-stage phasing, while the Script switch toggles between two phasing styles. The Phase 95 is set to modern style phasing by default, which relies on feedback to create light harmonic distortion and gives the effect a more accentuated swoosh. Engaging the Script switch removes feedback for a lusher, more subdued sound with higher headroom and greater clarity. The familiar Speed control sets the rate of the effect. The Phase 95 may be small, but it's full of rich phase tones, and it'll take a beating on the road.

This little orange box went on to become the sole icon of its effect category, and countless legendary riffs have benefitted from the sonic qualities of this pedal. No matter the genre or instrument, the Phase 90 has been there through it all to add its distinctly lush voice to a musician's tone palette. With the twist of the Rate knob, you can take the Phase 90's warm modulation from subtle, spatial shimmer to all-out high velocity swooshing.

\n
This device has found its way into many of Eddie Van Halen's recordings, adding a shimmery velocity to lead passages or a more dramatic swoosh to muted strumming.

There is one overdrive circuit to this day has been the most talked about, \r\nthe most sought after, and the most mythical of them all. It’s big, it’s \r\nexpensive, and it has certainly earned its place at the table. Wampler has \r\npainstakingly and faithfully reproduced that magical tone in all its glory in an \r\nunbelievably small package, and its name is Tumnus.

\r\n
Tumnus is a versatile addition to any setup, any style. Stack it with another \r\npedal to help push or shape the total amount of gain, use it as a stand alone \r\noverdrive, or use it as a slightly dirty boost to push the front end of your amp \r\nover the edge. You can even use it as a buffer, because just like the original \r\nthis pedal is not true bypass. Instead, faithful to the original, this pedal \r\ncontains a buffered bypass tone legendary in its own right.

\r\n
The Tumnus’ streamlined 3 control knobs (Volume, Gain, and Treble) allow you \r\nto quickly dial in your tones no matter what the gig calls for. We aren’t going \r\nto sit here and claim it has magical parts, or we sourced out 60 year old diodes \r\nthat make it perfect, but we are going to say that during our research we looked \r\nat everything available and then only used the parts that Brian chose to \r\nreplicate that amazing tone.

\r\n
Let’s face it, not everyone has room for a four-legged beast on their board. \r\nThis smaller version slips in and out of a myriad of tight situations. Now you \r\ncan have the tone. Now you can have history. Now you can have it all without \r\nhaving to sell your prized gear possessions. The Wampler Tumnus, standing up for \r\nthat amazing tone, but without the outrageous claims often associated with it.

We should all be so lucky as to be identified by the sound of a single note. Some players are so well defined that their entire musical journey can be heard in a single note they play. Tone is in the fingers. Tone is in the mind. Effects can be a great way of expressing emotions or creating textures. The Dark Side is about creating sounds and adding new tones to your symphony. It’s the things you can’t create with your fingers or mind. It’s metasymphonic. The Dark Side provides all the textures that define an essence, in one pedal.

\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
Atom
\r\n
The individual pieces that make up the Dark Side workstation are Fuzz, Delay \r\nand Modulation. The Fuzz side of the Dark Side is a big fuzz style distortion \r\nbased on a 1977 op-amp style. We used something similar in our Psi Fuzz. This \r\none is completely and radically different. We made what seemed like endless \r\nchanges to extract the nuances of earlier transistor based fuzzes. We gained it way to down to fit the time period and the style. This is a more \r\ntransparent Big Fuzz. This one lets your guitar sing with sustain, yet retains \r\nthe essence of you guitar whether single coil or humbucker based.

\r\n
The next core element in the Dark Side pedal is the Delay and Modulation \r\nside. You can select between a multi-head tape delay effect or between a \r\ncombination of 4 different modulation sounds.  The Dark Side delay has 12 \r\ndifferent syncopated delays. They are rhythmic and have the tonal quality of \r\nthe old spinning drum tape delays. The Dark Side has many subtle filters to get \r\nthe tape delay setting to have the feel and warmth of the original machines, yet \r\ngives you range of control to have modern features like expression pedal control \r\nfor the number of repeats. You can use it for creating a feedback oscillation \r\ndelay. Extremely subtle modulations in the delay make it very musical.

\r\n
The next atom in this workstation is the modulation effect. There are four \r\nparts to this effect.  Flanger, Rotary Speaker Cabinet, U-Vibe, and Phaser. You \r\ncan blend between the “Electric Lady” Flanger and a Les-Rotary cabinet, creating \r\nnew sounds. You can find that perfect blend between a vintage sounding \r\nopto-coupler based U-Vibe and the little orange phaser.

\r\n
There is also an Expression Pedal port on the pedal. It is highly \r\nrecommended to have an expression pedal handy. You can make many adjustments on \r\nthe fly that just increase the fun and functionality of the pedal while you’re \r\ncreating music. It has to be a TRS style expression pedal. We suggest \r\nsomething like the M-Audio or Moog expression pedals.

\r\n
You spoke and we listened!  Make America TRS-Free Again.  Okay, we heard you, \r\nyou can’t switch order on the fly during a gig.  You never used the TRS cable to \r\ninsert effects. You just tossed the cable aside.  You all said YES when we said \r\neffect-order switch. New units have a simple push button switch to change the \r\norder!  Mike Hermans did a new video with the effect-order switcher.

\r\n
Mike Hermans Demo of the Dark Side  – Effect Order Switch.

\r\n
On older units there is a TRS Insert for adding effects in between the Fuzz \r\nand Modulation/Delay side of the pedal. This is handy if you have phaser or \r\nchorus pedal you might want to add if you want to use the Delay side of the Dark \r\nSide. That way you can have Fuzz>Phaser>Delay for example.

\r\n
 

\r\n
Heart
\r\n
At the heart of the Dark Side is a hand built board that contains analog fuzz \r\nand a high quality 24-bit DSP engine. We studied and analyzed decades worth of \r\ngear and crafted our own sounds that give you not only the original tones, but \r\nan endless range of in-between sounds you can’t get elsewhere.  Even if you have \r\nother Keeley effects or workstations, you don’t have these exact sounds. The \r\nRotary is slightly different than the Monterey, it’s more chorus like. The \r\nFlanger is different than the hidden one on the Bubble Tron. The U-Vibe on this \r\npedal is also deeper and throbs with more intensity.  If you were lucky enough \r\nto get one of the Jimi Hazel Phase Delays or put the Bubble Tron into the hidden \r\nbank 2 mode; well then you have heard our 4 stage phaser. It’s dead on and a \r\nblast to play. Like the Monterey, this unit is completely hand built. \r\nIncluding the high-end DSP, everything is hand assembled and soldered by our \r\ntechnicians with decades of experience.  Attention to detail and tone at every \r\npoint.

\r\n
\r\n
Mother
\r\n
What you get is a Mother Lode of effects and sounds. Necessity is the Mother \r\nof Invention. Someone needed to put all these epic sounds in one box.  So we \r\ndid. There’s no need to wish you were here, get out your Strat and we’ll see \r\nyou on the Dark Side.

Active bass and mid controls, as well as a regular treble control (the same as the pedal it was inspired by), encourages you to sculpt the tone from this pedal to the demands of your rig. Whether you’re boosting a driven amp or another pedal, using the pedal as a stand-alone overdrive, or crowning it your “always on” tonal sweetener, you’ll find the Tumnus Deluxe’s wide-ranging controls make it much more than just another clone.

Fusing premium amp and effect tones with breakthrough BOSS spatial \r\ntechnology, the revolutionary Waza-Air takes the guitar experience where it’s \r\nnever gone before. This personal amplifier system brings stunning realism to \r\nplaying with headphones, using a gyro sensor and moving 3D space to deliver \r\nnatural “amp-in-room” tone that’s rich, resonant, and infinitely inspiring. \r\nAll-wireless connectivity means there are no cables to slow you down, and you \r\ncan stream music from your phone and play as if you’re performing on stage in a \r\nfull band. And with the BOSS Tone Studio app, you’re able to craft custom sounds \r\nwith five amp types and over 50 different effects.

The Continuing Evolution of Waza Innovation

\r\n
In BOSS Waza tradition, Waza-Air brings decades of expertise together with \r\ncutting-edge innovation to present a breakthrough musical product that truly \r\npushes the envelope. Far more than a simple guitar-based headphone amp, Waza-Air \r\nmelds our premium amp, effects, and wireless technologies with dynamic 3D sound, \r\ndelivering a unique guitar amplification experience that’s never been available \r\nuntil now.

\r\n
Inspiring “Amp-in-Room” Tone

\r\n
For most of us, playing guitar through headphones is necessary to avoid \r\nbothering others. Unfortunately, they lack the depth and presence of playing a \r\nreal amp in a real room, resulting in a less-than-satisfying experience. \r\nWaza-Air changes all that, restoring the natural dimension, resonance, and \r\n“moving air” feel that’s lost with traditional phones. An integrated gyro sensor \r\ntracks your head movements as you play, driving sophisticated 3D algorithms that \r\nprovide spatial realism that must be heard to be believed. And it all happens \r\nautomatically, so all you have to do is plug in and go!

\r\n
Premium Amps and Effects

\r\n
Waza-Air features tones and controls derived from the stage-class Katana \r\namplifiers, with full user customization and a variety of ready-to-play presets \r\navailable via the free BOSS Tone Studio app. Five different amp types provide \r\ntones from classic clean to high gain, plus a full-range voice that’s perfect \r\nfor bass and acoustic-electric guitar. Over 50 effect types are available as \r\nwell, including mod, delay, and reverb effects optimized for Waza-Air’s unique \r\nspatial experience. And with six onboard memories, you can store favorite setups \r\nand recall them with dedicated buttons.

\r\n
Choose Your Space

\r\n
Waza-Air’s advanced ambience setups provide three realistic environments to \r\nplay in. Surround mode places the amp in a virtual room, providing an immersive \r\nexperience like playing in a recording studio. Things get even more real with \r\nStatic mode, where the combined amp and room sound changes depending on where \r\nyou move your head. Finally, Stage mode lets you step into the spotlight, with \r\nthe amp sound coming from a virtual backline behind you.

\r\n
Stream Music and Take Center Stage

\r\n
In addition to providing a wireless connection to BOSS Tone Studio, \r\nWaza-Air’s built-in Bluetooth lets you jam along with songs and backing tracks \r\nfrom your smartphone or tablet. In Stage mode, the streaming music plays from \r\nthe backline along with your amp, putting you in a virtual band! Just close your \r\neyes and perform alongside your favorite music artists, and step up to center \r\nstage when it’s time for your big solo. Song volume and playback can be \r\ncontrolled right from Waza-Air, with no need to touch your mobile device.

\r\n
No Wires, No Hassle

\r\n
All audio connectivity with Waza-Air is 100-percent wireless for a \r\nhassle-free experience. With the ability to move and play in complete freedom, \r\nyou’ll never get tangled in a guitar lead or pull off your headphones by \r\nstepping on a cable. And thanks to advanced wireless tech inherited from BOSS’s \r\nacclaimed WL series, you’ll always enjoy premium sound quality and great playing \r\nfeel with ultra-low latency. Auto standby and wake functions conserve battery \r\nlife between playing sessions, minimizing the need to plug in and recharge.

\r\n
High-Quality Sound and Rugged Build

\r\n
Equipped with large, custom-designed 50 mm drivers, Waza-Air provides rich, \r\nfull sound for both guitar playing and music listening. The conforming earpads \r\nand wide headband are super-comfortable for extended playing sessions, while the \r\nrugged build ensures lasting durability for everyday practice and jamming. \r\nWaza-Air folds down into a very compact size for storage, and it’s possible to \r\nswivel the ear pieces into a flat orientation for sliding into a guitar bag’s \r\npocket.

Compact and lightweight, Adio-Air-GT is a Bluetooth equipped high-wattage guitar amp boasting 50W of stereo output. It delivers an incredible sense of volume that outperforms many amps in its class. Whether it's used as an amp or Bluetooth speaker, Adio provides an amazing playing or listening experience.

\n
50W amp that outperforms its size
\n
Though it is compact and lightweight, the Adio is equipped with a high-wattage power amp boasting 50W of stereo output. It delivers a startling sense of volume that outperforms other amps in its class. The 2 x 3”stereo speaker system makes for an incredible playing and listening experience. Because it is capable of such high-output, the Adio is equally effective as an at-home practice amp as it is a full-fledged performing amp.

\n
Proprietary chassis design ensures powerful and clear sound
\n
Adio provides both the hard-hitting cabinet resonance of a guitar/bass amp, and the high fidelity of home audio speakers. Thanks to new concepts used in its cabinet structure, the multi-purpose Adio excels in both scenarios. It features a bass reflex structure that delivers a sound density far exceeding the unit’s size, and an inner box that emanates the sense of spatiality and depth you expect from stereo speakers. The speakers are contained in a sophisticated slant-body design, creating powerful and high-quality sound that shines for both performance and listening.

\n
A divided cabinet design
\n
To prevent unwanted cabinet resonance, the inner box that secures the speakers is completely separated from the rear cabinet. Additionally, the inner box separates L and R into independent spaces to produce stereo playback with an enhanced sense of spatiality. Rigidity is enhanced by a chassis design that minimizes parallel surfaces, suppressing unwanted vibration that would adversely affect the quality of the sound.

\n
Honeycomb-structure speaker frame
\n
The front grille uses a honeycomb structure that perforates the speaker area with a set of hexagons. This efficiently maintains strength, yet ensures maximum space. The high ratio of openness means that the speaker is not obstructed, allowing the sound to be clear and direct.

\n
Ported design further enhances low-frequency playback
\n
The bass reflex section uses a flair component that creates a smooth widening at the entry and exit of the cabinet’s port. This minimizes unwanted noise and also enhances the bass reflex efficiency to further boost the low-frequency playback.

\n
Unique shape allows for enhanced listening experience
\n
The unique slanted design of the Adio allows you to position it with the speakers pointing diagonally upward so that the output reaches your ears directly even at short distances. This means that you can enjoy always performing or listening in the sweet spot. The chassis is designed to minimise parallel surfaces, delivering a smooth sound that suppresses any internal resonances.

\n
A handle that’s integrated with the cabinet
\n
With a recessed slot built into the back of the cabinet, the Adio combines sleek looks with convenient portability.

\n
Battery-powered with eight hours of continuous operation
\n
Lightweight body is only 2.9 kg / 6.39 lb.
\n
In spite of its high output power, the Adio can also operate on batteries. Eight AA batteries allow up to eight hours of continuous operation. At a mere 2.9 kg / 6.39 lb. in weight, the Adio is also highly portable. You can take it with you to enjoy performing or listening anywhere.

\n
Vox’s proprietary VET (Virtual Element Technology) modelling technology
\n
The Adio uses VET (Virtual Elements Technology). Instead of simply imitating the output sound of the original amp, VET meticulously models even its components and circuit design. Without relying on the ears of individual engineers, and without being influenced by the condition of a specific amp unit, VET perfectly reproduces the characteristics of the original amp. And it’s equipped with a high-performance DSP to ensure high sound quality.

\n
In addition, the distortion algorithms on the Adio Air GT have been refined, allowing you to enjoy the ultimate touch response that reflects your finest picking nuances without obscuring them.

In a bold Fender first, the Tone Master Deluxe Reverb Blonde amplifier uses massive digital processing power to achieve a single remarkable sonic feat: faithfully modeling the circuitry and 22-watt power output of an original Deluxe tube amp. A high-performance 100-watt digital power amp is used to achieve the headroom and dynamic range of a real vintage Deluxe tube amp. The resonant pine cabinet is paired with a single Celestion® NEO Creamback speaker for a more distinctive rock 'n' roll flavor. The result is tubeless Deluxe Reverb tone, volume and dynamics virtually indistinguishable from the all-tube original. The amp model has been modified to remove the virtual bright cap on the Vibrato channel, which gives modern players greater tonal flexibility when using distortion and overdrive pedals. Additionally, the reverb control now provides easier fine tuning at lower settings. Perhaps most notably, even with all these features and more, the Tone Master Deluxe Reverb is in fact about only half the weight of an all-tube Deluxe.

\n
The blonde vinyl covering elegantly evokes classic early-’60s Fender vibe, and front panel features give guitarists a playing experience identical to the tube version, including Fender’s world-standard reverb and tremolo effects. Additional rear-panel features deliver modern convenience and flexibility—including an output power selector for full power and five attenuated settings, balanced XLR line output with impulse response (IR) cabinet simulations captured with Shure SM57 and Sennheiser MD421 microphones, mute switch for silent stage or recording use, USB port for firmware upgrades, and more.

One of the most popular amplifiers of all time lives again in the ’57 Custom Champ. Renown for its flexibility, ease-of-use and knockout tone, this is the classic sound heard on thousands of recordings. A wide variety of playable tones inhabit this hand-wired performer—from crisp, classic cleans to naturally compressed overdrive that responds remarkably to guitar volume and picking dynamic changes.

\n
The Fender 5F1 circuit used in the ’57 Custom Champ has become legendary for its heightened dynamic response and sweet sounding tube overdrive when pushed. A 12AY7 preamp tube matched to a classic 6V6 power amp tube and 5Y3GT rectifier tube work together to generate this in-demand overdrive. When the volume is cranked, this little wonder sings with the natural compression and rich even-order harmonics of a power tube working at peak output in Class A topology. The 8” 4-ohm Weber Special Design alnico speaker stays true to the classic Champ sound, compressing to create fat tone at higher levels while more than ably reproducing the raunchy tones found at the top of the amp’s volume knob. The hand-wired circuit includes newly sourced yellow coupling capacitors chosen for their authentically vintage Fender tone—sparkly cleans and creamy overdrive with smooth top end and round mids.

\n
Of course this amp sounds great; it also retains classic Champ visual appeal—lacquered tweed, chickenhead knob, leather handle and ¼” inputs for low or high output instruments are all here. In the studio, the 5-watt design means you’ll be able to explore the full range of available tones without overloading sensitive microphones (or your ears). Updated components, hand-wired craftsmanship and a classic circuit design all combine to create the ’57 Custom Champ, a style-spanning performer. Includes a protective cover.

The PowerStage™ 170 is a game-changing product for guitar players that have \r\ndreamed of the day their entire rig can live on their pedal board. Maybe you \r\nlove your tube amp but don’t want to lug it around. Or perhaps you use a modeler \r\nthat has a ton of functionality but doesn’t sound as good when plugged in to \r\nyour amp. Do you dread fly dates or gigs because you’re never sure what your \r\nbackline will be? This is a 170-watt power amp with a beautiful clean preamp \r\nsection and 3-band global EQ, making it the perfect complement to pedalboards \r\nand digital modeling devices. It is small enough to fit directly on a pedalboard \r\nor in any gig bag, lightweight enough for fly dates, and attractive enough to \r\nlook great at a church or coffeehouse gig, as well as in a home office or dorm \r\nroom.

\r\n
The PowerStage 170 will give you reliable, musical power on every gig, \r\neliminating the uncertainty that backline amps can bring. Simply bring your \r\nguitar and your pedalboard and get your tone through whatever cab is provided. \r\nThe 170’s intuitive 3-band analog EQ allows for quickly fine-tuning your sound \r\nfor any cabinet and any venue—no need to wrestle with the cumbersome and \r\nineffective EQs on digital gear or modify your stompbox settings. Everything you \r\nneed is right there. You can even adjust the big Master Volume knob with your \r\nfoot, boosting solos and controlling dynamics in real time. And when you bypass \r\nyour overdrive and distortion boxes, it will function as your clean channel, \r\nwith the sweet, warm sound that we associate with great amps. Not every power \r\namp can do that.

\r\n
Imagine the freedom of showing up at a gig with a streamlined, lightweight \r\nrig that you can get up and running in under five minutes, with the confidence \r\nthat comes from knowing that you will have your sound, no matter what. Forget \r\nabout cartage, forget about complicated setups, forget about backline issues, \r\nand think about the PowerStage 170.Like our award-winning pedals, the PowerStage \r\n170 is designed and assembled at our Santa Barbara, California, factory by the \r\nsame team responsible for our legendary pickups.

The Laney LA30D is a dual-channel 30W RMS acoustic amplifier combo, ideal for \r\nperformance and rehearsal.

\r\n
Designed and engineered in the UK, the LA30D calls on Laney’s 50-year history \r\nof amplifier building to provide versatility, portability, and reliability to \r\nall levels of player from the rehearsal room to the stage.

\r\n
At 7.4kg (16.3lbs), the LA30D is compact yet packed for performance. 30 watts \r\nreal RMS linear output power is allied with pair of 6.5” drivers. These \r\ncustom-designed speakers house a unique dual-cone design which deliver full, \r\nnatural acoustic sound-reproduction with plenty of high-end sparkle.

\r\n
Two independent input channels both offer the choice of balanced XLR or \r\nunbalanced jack inputs and both can have Reverb assigned to them as required. \r\nThis flexibility allows for connection of a mic and instrument, two different \r\nacoustic instruments or even a blend of separate mic and pickup connections from \r\nthe same instrument.

\r\n
Plus, with an additional Aux in connection for backing tracks, the LA30D is \r\nideal for acoustic guitar + vocal performances.

\r\n
The ‘Instrument’ channel features useful tone-shaping via a three-band EQ \r\nplus a ‘Shape’ control for instant single button optimization for \r\nelectro-acoustic guitar sounds. Variable Chorus and/or Reverb is on hand for \r\nfurther sound enhancement without the need for external effects units.

\r\n
The Chorus is visibly engaged with a green LED light which will then pulse \r\ngiving an indication of the LFO (low frequency oscillator) rate. This rate can \r\nthen also be adjusted by simply holding down the Chorus switch and turning the \r\nReverb control pot. On letting go of the Chorus switch, the rate is stored and \r\nwill even be recalled at the next switch on.

\r\n
A simple but very effective Anti-Feedback button can be engaged to \r\nautomatically scan for and then eliminate unwanted feedback. A Phase switch is \r\nalso on hand to remove of destructive interference which can occur when a player \r\nis too close to the amplifier; a simple solution at the switch of a single \r\nbutton.

\r\n
On both XLR inputs Phantom power is permanently available for use with a \r\ncondenser or dynamic microphone.

\r\n
A balanced D.I. out provides direct, mic-free connection to a mixer or active \r\nspeaker system for larger performance situations.

Katana Gen 3: Inspiration Unbound
\r\n
Backed by our advanced Tube Logic amplifier architecture and reactive Class AB power, the BOSS Katana series has become a standard for guitarists everywhere since its introduction in 2016. Katana amps embody decades of BOSS development knowledge, providing professional, tube-inspired sound coupled with modern advantages like onboard effects, one-touch memory recall, deep sound customization, and reduced weight. Katana Gen 3 elevates the lineup with even more range and versatility, bringing you a playing experience that goes where no other amps can.

\r\n
Refined Tube Logic Tones
\r\n
Tube Logic recreates tube circuitry and all its complex interactions at a component level, putting the coveted tone and feel of classic tube amp designs under your fingers. Our approach continues to evolve with refinements to the five amp characters available in previous Katana models, including the iconic high-gain Brown type. The new Pushed character spotlights internal dynamic enhancements with the pleasing touch-responsive gain of a clean combo driven into harmonic saturation. All six amp characters include a selectable variation, giving you 12 distinctive tones to support every musical style.

\r\n
“Sweet Spot” Sound at Any Volume
\r\n
As every tube amp lover knows, the sound becomes richer, fuller, and more responsive as you turn up the volume. Unfortunately, it also gets way too loud for many playing situations. An external power attenuator is a common solution, but it can introduce artifacts that color the amp’s tone and feel. The integrated Power Control in Katana Gen 3 delivers the best of all worlds, letting you dial in cranked-amp inspiration with no adverse effect on the sound. Just turn the panel knob to transparently harness the level for everything from live stage playing to daily bedroom jams.

\r\n
Famous BOSS Effects
\r\n
Katana Gen 3 features five simultaneous effect categories loaded with essential selections from the historic BOSS library. Booster, Mod, FX, Delay, and Reverb sections offer enhanced sound quality, grab-and-go parameter controls, and three variations each for access to 15 unique effects. BOSS Tone Studio unlocks additional possibilities, allowing you to customize the onboard effects from 60 different types and tweak deep options not available from the amp’s panel. And when the optional Bluetooth® Audio MIDI Dual Adaptor is installed, you can wirelessly edit sounds on the gig using the BTS editor app on your smartphone.

\n
With the Rocker 15 set wide open, smaller venues are comfortably taken care. Thanks to the same beefy transformers as the combo version, the Rocker 15 has a remarkably potent delivery which takes full advantage of its EL84 output section. Even when scaling back the power, the amp’s tone stays fat and full, oozing warm valve compression and saturation without disturbing the neighbours.

\n
Clever options aside, the Rocker 15 has real character – a twin channel design with a twist. The Natural channel is a purist’s dream with just a single knob: Volume. Finely balanced and supremely playable, this channel is perfectly voiced to bring out the ‘natural’ sound of the instrument under your fingers (or the pedals under your feet). The ‘Dirty’ channel is a more familiar affair with controls for Gain, Volume and a three band EQ section. Both channels are very sensitive to touch and playing dynamics, making Rocker 15 very versatile despite its straightforward, player-friendly layout.

\n
The amp also features a proper valve driven effects loop for total purity from input to output. So, whether you need a rig for low-volume practising, recording, or to be heard on the club circuit, the shape-shifting Rocker 15 will show itself to be the amp for every occasion.

The Tone King Ironman II is a 100w precision compensated reactive power attenuator with a sophisticated design that allows you to reduce the volume level at the speaker(s) while allowing the amplifier to operate at full output power. The Ironman II preserves every ounce of the tone and feel of your amplifier, for natural power-tube overdrive and distortion. The 18 distinct attenuation settings let you choose the amount of output power that is being sent to the speakers, while the rest of the amplifier's power dissipates within the Ironman II.

\n
What makes the Ironman II work unlike any other attenuator is the tuned reactive load and the transformer coupled power division circuitry.

\n
Ideally, the load seen by an amplifier should have the appropriate complex impedance curve so that it responds as it does to a real speaker load. A real speaker load varies greatly with frequency. For example, the impedance of a typical \"8 ohm\" speaker may rise to 60 ohms or more at its resonant frequency (usually around 60-80Hz), and then rise again to many tens of ohms at high frequencies. An amplifier responds a lot differently when driving a complex load like this, compared to a simple resistive load (as is used in most attenuators). Tone King developed the Ironman's reactive load circuit by matching the results of impedance curve measurements, ran on an actual speaker and then tweaked the resulting design through an empirical method in order to create a load circuit that is most effective at preserving the tone and feel of your amplifier.

\n
The second part of the equation is the circuitry that divides the power from your amplifier between the speaker and the load. In other attenuators, this is often done with a resistor ladder. There are two problems with this approach - first, the resistor ladder itself can become a part of the load, which means that the amplifier sees a simple resistive load. Second, in dividing the power this way, a voltage divider is effectively formed between the dividing network and the speaker. Since the speaker has a complex impedance that varies with frequency, the result is that the frequency response at the speaker is altered, usually dulling the top end and muddying the sound. To address this, the Iron Man II uses 100% transformer coupling via a set of custom audio transformers, so that the connection between the amplifier-to-load and between the amplifier-to-speaker is purely transformer coupled at every step of the attenuation dial. This is an expensive and elaborate design (each step of the dial requires its own tap on one of the custom transformers), but is significantly more effective at preserving the tone and feel of your amplifier than other methods.

The Crush Bass 100 features an EQ circuit inspired by our prestigious 4 Stroke Series amplifiers. At its centre is a parametric mid band. This presents players with a much greater degree of control over the sound than a traditional EQ, allowing them to vary the frequencies they want hear. The mid band covers a wide range, sweeping from 300Hz (fully anti-clockwise) to 2.7kHz (fully clockwise), meaning this amp can be fine tuned to suit any musical style. The active circuitry allows for up to 15dB of boost or cut on the bass and middle frequencies, and up to 20dB on the treble side.

\n
BLEND & GAIN

\n
Lifted straight from our popular OB1 Series amps, the Blend and Gain controls are a nod to the many bass players who experiment with guitar and bass amps simultaneously. In this ‘bi-amped’ setup, layers of harmonics and distortion from the guitar amp are blended with the core bass tone to create the ultimate full-range live sound. The Crush Bass 100’s Gain and Blend controls create the same effect in a single package, adding extra bite and crispness to the tone at lower gain settings, right up to all-out filth with the dials cranked. These controls can also be engaged remotely with the optional FS-1 footswitch, ideal for fattening your sound on the fly.

\n
DISCRETE OUTPUT STAGE & ANALOGUE DESIGN

\n
At the heart of the Crush Bass 100 is its 100 Watt output stage. Using discrete circuitry, rather than ICs (integrated circuits) ensures a purer and even more forceful delivery with outstanding clarity and definition. The Crush Bass 100 houses a 15” speaker with a reflex port for improved low end response. The buffered effects loop has been engineered for maximum transparency, ensuring your pedal arsenal will perform at its peak.

\n
BALANCED OUTPUT, CABSIM HEADPHONE OUTPUT, AUX INPUT & CHROMATIC TUNER

\n
The Crush Bass 100 features a balanced output (post EQ) for connecting to a PA for live situations. The headphone output features our Cabsim circuitry which emulates the response of our stage-ready OBC bass speaker cabinets during silent practice. This signal can also be sent to a console for seriously authentic direct recording. The Aux. input allows for connecting external audio sources for backing tracks whilst the handy onboard tuner makes for quick tune-ups between jams.

For high-end piano performance in a portable instrument, there’s no better choice than the Roland FP-90X. Like the rest of the FP-X series, it features a slim and stylish cabinet that’s easy to transport. But when you invest in this range-topping model, you’re getting an instrument that represents the pinnacle of Roland’s acclaimed piano technology. From the addictively playable PHA-50 hybrid keyboard and PureAcoustic Piano Modeling from our premium pianos, to custom tone shaping and deep sound immersion from the onboard speaker system, the FP-90X delivers the ultimate FP-X experience.

\r\n\r\n
Roland’s finest acoustic pianos, customizable for your touch
\r\n
While all FP-X series pianos provide highly authentic tone, the FP-90X goes beyond. With astonishing accuracy, Roland’s PureAcoustic Piano Modeling sound engine reproduces every aspect of how the rich, resonant sound of an acoustic grand piano is created. Choose from elegant Concert and dynamic Stage pianos via eight ready-to-play variations. Then dive deeper with the onboard Piano Designer, personalizing the sound like a piano technician through a range of easy-to-adjust parameters. And with My Stage and PureAcoustic Ambience, you can instantly immerse yourself in a variety of realistic environments, from studios to concert halls. The FP-90X’s piano tones are almost infinite—and each is the best in its class.

\r\n\r\n
Dive into immersive sound with the powerful four-speaker system.
\r\n
With a high-fidelity onboard sound system that projects your music from every angle, no other FP-X series piano can match the sonic depth and wide dynamic range of the FP-90X. A pair of powerful woofers and twin dome tweeters work in harmony with special vents in the cabinet’s back, producing a deep sound field that fully envelops the playing position. In addition to home playing, this full-range system makes the FP-90X a powerful and flexible choice for intimate live performances. And just as important for private practice is the Headphones Acoustic Projection feature, giving you that same thrill of immersion with tone that seems to fill the room—even when nobody else can hear it.

\r\n\r\n\r\n
All the feel of an acoustic grand, without the maintenance.
\r\n
The FP-90X’s PHA-50 keyboard—also found in Roland’s top-level home pianos—is an innovative hybrid that gives you the best of both worlds, combining the feel and texture of acoustic piano keys with unbeatable durability. The warm touch of the wood sides will be instantly familiar to seasoned players, while the composite center frame extends from the front of the keys to the back for a stable, assured touch. A crafted hammer action mechanism ensures authentic response, while the look and feel of ivory and ebony are reproduced in minute detail. It’s just like playing a traditional acoustic grand—minus the regular maintenance.

\r\n\r\n
Heavyweight features in a portable format.
\r\n
The FP-90X fuses its powerful features into a stylish format that works for modern musicians at home or on the move. With compact dimensions and surprisingly light weight for a hammer-action instrument, it shifts easily around your living space and stores easily in a closet or vehicle. You can supplement your FP-90X by adding a KSC-90 stand and KPD-90 three-pedal unit for a traditional upright experience, or with the portable KS-20X stand and RPU-3 pedal unit for gigging.

\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
Enhance your music making with Bluetooth and USB.
\r\n
The FP-90X’s best-in-class piano features are just the start. Via Bluetooth audio, you can stream music from a phone or tablet through the piano’s sound system and jam along. And with Bluetooth MIDI, you’re able to connect with fun music composition apps like Roland’s Zenbeats or Apple’s GarageBand. If you like to sing, connect a microphone, add effects, and amplify your vocals through the speakers, and capture them along with your piano playing using the onboard recorder. The FP-90X even features USB audio/MIDI connectivity, allowing you to interface with computers and record tracks in professional music production software.

A LIGHT & PORTABLE PIANO-STYLE KEYBOARD
\r\n
A 61-key (NP-15) and 76-key keyboard (NP-35) that allows you to perform piano \r\npieces with greater authenticity, without requiring much space. Although the keys \r\nhave the same box shape as those on a piano, the keyboard has a lighter feel \r\nthat makes it easy for novice pianists to start, rather than the weightier feel \r\nof a standard piano keyboard. You can also use headphones with the Piaggero if \r\nyou are worried about disturbing those around you with your playing

\r\n
\r\n\r\nIT'S JUST SO LIGHT! YOU \r\nCAN TAKE IT ANYWHERE
\r\n
\"Piaggero,\" the name of the NP-Series, combines \"Piano\" with the word \r\n\"leggero,\" a musical term meaning, \"light.\" As the name states, the NP-35 and \r\nNP-15 are extremely light, even for a portable keyboard, so that you can take it \r\nanywhere. Indoors, outdoors, or even on a trip, feel free to take it to your \r\nfavourite places and practice.

\r\n
\r\n\r\nENJOY A LIGHT KEYBOARD FEELTHAT MAKES PIANO PLAYING FUN!
\r\n
\r\n
\r\nMaybe you want to learn how to play the piano, but the keys feel so heavy you \r\nthink your fingers will tire out; or maybe you think your fingers aren’t strong \r\nenough to achieve sufficiently strong fortes. It would be a shame to let such \r\ntrivial concerns discourage you from playing the piano. The Piaggero’s light \r\nkeyboard feel lets you experience the joy of playing a keyboard.

\r\n
\r\nEven with its softer touch, the Piaggero’s sound changes realistically in \r\nresponse to the force of your keystrokes, enabling you to enjoy expressiveness \r\napproaching that of an acoustic piano. Like conventional pianos, the keys on the \r\nNP-35 are heavier in the bass register and lighter in the treble (Graded \r\nSoftTouch). Experience the piano-like feel and light touch of this new keyboard.

\r\n
\r\nPIANIST FOR EVEN MORE \r\nCONVENIENCE
\r\n\r\n
\r\n
\r\nConnect the instrument to Yamaha’s \" \r\nPianist app, \r\ndeveloped exclusively for use with Yamaha’s digital pianos, for even more intuitive operation than when operating the instrument itself. In addition to operating the instrument itself, Smart Pianist can also display music scores.

\r\n
\r\nBASIC OPERATIONSARE EASY!A MINIMALIST DESIGN \r\nWITH ONLY THE \r\nFUNCTIONS YOU NEED
\r\n\r\n
\r\n
\r\nThe Piaggero is an instrument for people who love the piano. Its design features aspects are reminiscent of a piano focuses on only the most functions, making it usable and allowing who are not used to instruments the ability to it intuitively.

\r\n

Beautiful, powerful sound sampled from the acclaimed yamaha cfx concert grand piano
\n
The YDP-S55 models all features a piano Voice sampled from Yamaha’s flagship CFX concert grand piano—a renowned piano that delivers sparkling highs and a powerful resonant bass combined in a superbly expressive sound.

\n
The YDP-S55 has the same detailed sound—from the lower keys to the higher keys—full of clarity and rich in colorful harmonic content. It gives you extraordinary expressive power and nuance, that authentically responds in your daily practice as well as your most emotion-filled performances.

\n
Authentic acoustic piano playability and half-damper pedal control
\n
With an 88-key piano action, the GH3 (Graded Hammer 3) keyboard reproduces the touch of an acoustic piano, from a naturally heavy feel in the lower key to a lighter touch in the upper octaves. The GH3 keyboard provides a grand piano-style response and feel, allowing rapid note repetition and authentic expressive control. Moreover, there’s a half-damper feature that authentically replicates the damper action on a grand piano, providing rich expressive variation.

\n
Harmonic resonance like that of a grand piano—virtual resonance modeling lite (vrm lite)
\n
One of the allures of the grand piano is the sympathetic resonance created by the vibration of the entire instrument. The YDP-S55 elaborately reproduces this rich sympathetic resonance through a groundbreaking technology called Virtual Resonance Modeling Lite (VRM Lite). VRM Lite creates a richly varied sound by simulating the complex sympathetic tones created when the vibrations of the strings are propagated to the soundboard and other strings, corresponding to the timing and intensity of key playing and pedaling.

\n
Rich variety of built-in songs, and intuitive operation with smart pianist app
\n
Naturally, the YDP-S55 has an authentic grand piano sound, but it also features various other built-in instrument sounds, for a total of 10 Voices—including electric piano, organ, vibraphone, and strings.

\n
The YDP-S55 also has 353 built-in songs, including 50 famous classical songs, and 303 comprehensive practice exercises from famous methods, such as Beyer, Burgmüller, Czerny, and Hanon. The instrument is also compatible with Yamaha's free Smart Pianist app—simply download the app to your smart device and connect it to the instrument*.

\n
With the Smart Pianist app, you can easily operate the various Voice functions of the instrument and use it to call up scores of the built-in songs. It also features a comprehensive Piano Room function for changing the tonal quality and resonance settings of the piano sound.

\n
* A cable connection is required. Make sure to purchase the correct cable for your smart device.

\n
Features for greater listening comfort when using headphones
\n
The YDP-S55 employs new technology that corrects the sound balance optimally according to the volume you set—giving you an exceptionally natural sound that’s easy to listen to and is gentle on the ears, even when playing for a long time.

\n
It also has Stereophonic Optimizer effect that lets you enjoy the natural, spacious sound you experience sitting in front of an acoustic grand piano, even when wearing headphones.

\n
Slim, stylish design allows for neat installation
\n
The piano cabinet has a slim depth that lets you neatly install it in any room, and makes for a chic, stylish design that effortlessly enhances your living space. Moreover, closing the keyboard lid gives the instrument a flat, unassuming look.

\n
Limiting the maximum volume
\n
A new Volume Limiter function lets you set a fixed maximum volume level, to protect your hearing from loud sound over the speakers or headphones.

\n
Record and play back your performances
\n
The YDP-S55 has powerful tools that let you record and check your performances, or record a part with just one hand and practice the other part while listening along to the first. Moreover, you can record two parts separately—for example, the left- and right-hand parts, or record two Voices in succession to make a complete song and arrangement.

\n
Play along with a partner – in the same octave
\n
This effectively makes the instrument two keyboards in one, letting two players play the same piano sound and octave range side-by-side. This is especially useful when learning with a partner, letting you learn and practice parts together.

With an 88-key piano action, the GHS (Graded Hammer Standard) keyboard reproduces the touch of an acoustic piano, from a naturally heavy feel in the lower key to a lighter touch in the upper octaves.

Moreover, there’s a half-damper feature that authentically replicates the damper action on grand piano, providing rich expressive variation.

\n
One of the allures of the grand piano is the sympathetic resonance created by the vibration of the entire instrument. The YDP-S35 elaborately reproduces this rich sympathetic resonance through a groundbreaking technology called Virtual Resonance Modeling Lite (VRM Lite). VRM Lite creates a richly varied sound by simulating the complex sympathetic tones created when the vibrations of the strings are propagated to the soundboard and other strings, corresponding to the timing and intensity of key playing and pedaling.

Make sure to purchase the correct cable for your smart device.

The YDP-S35 employs new technology that corrects the sound balance optimally according to the volume you set—giving you an exceptionally natural sound that’s easy to listen to and is gentle on the ears, even when playing for a long time.

Premium Grand Performance in an Upright Cabinet
\n
The LX-9 is the flagship piano in the premium LX lineup. With commanding looks, unrivaled sound, and nuanced expression, the LX-9 embodies everything you’d expect from a high-end concert grand piano—with all the benefits of an advanced modern instrument. Enjoy a host of digital features to enhance your experience, like Bluetooth connectivity, wireless control with the Roland Piano App, and maintenance-free care. Highlights View the Gallery

\n
Elegant Expression
\n
Discover rich, full sound with complex overtones and harmonics delivered by Roland’s advanced Piano Reality Modeling technology. From pianissimo to fortissimo, breathe life into your music with a wide dynamic range and nuanced playability. Add depth to specific notes through half-pedaling with the continuous sustain pedal. And personalize the sound by changing the timbre of the piano.

\n
A Symphony of Sounds
\n
The versatile LX-9 provides an extensive spectrum of tonal nuances and expressive capabilities that intuitively adapt to your playing. Begin gently to evoke a dignified, soothing timbre, and when you crescendo, the tone dynamically brightens in response to your touch. As emotions and technique intertwine in your playing, the LX-9 faithfully mirrors your passion.

\n
Responsive Touch
\n
The LX-9 delivers an organic playing experience that naturally responds to your touch. From commanding fortissimo excerpts to half-touch and rapid trills, the sensitive keyboard translates unlimited tonal colors. Legato, staccato, and other articulations ring true with precision key release control. Haptic feedback and the escapement mechanism provide immediate acoustic interaction within expressive passages. Long hybrid keys allow for a consistent weighted feel regardless of the hand position on the keyboard, reducing the risk of strain during extended practice sessions or performances.

\n
Lose Yourself in Music
\n
A space’s ambience is a crucial part of an acoustic piano sound. From a vast concert hall to an intimate studio space, Piano Reality Ambience puts six environments at your fingertips. Eight speakers independently deliver the sound of different instrument elements, including string and cabinet resonances, subtle hammer noise, and more. When you want to play silently, plug in headphones for an immersive solo experience.

\n
A Sound Investment
\n
The LX-9’s classic upright design strikes a sophisticated pose in any environment. A movable lid and discreet blackout screen convey the same look as an acoustic piano. Second-floor installation woes are now a thing of the past—the LX-9 ships in two boxes for easy setup in any room. And thanks to its digital design, this fine instrument requires none of the regular tuning and other maintenance costs that come with owning an acoustic piano.

\n
Piano Designer
\n
Dive deeper into your piano’s sound and adjust the character of each note, including string tuning and temperament. Fine-tune the tone and resonance to your space for the optimal acoustic response. Then save your tuning adjustments as customized presets to summon if several pianists share the LX-9.

\n
Make a Connection
\n
Access deeper settings, play along with streamed music, find digital scores, and more when you pair with the Roland Piano App and other music apps via Bluetooth. Discover additional digital features like Twin Piano mode for same-range duets, an onboard recorder to evaluate progress, and a metronome to hone your timing skills.

For high-end piano performance in a portable instrument, there’s no better choice than the Roland FP-90X. Like the rest of the FP-X series, it features a slim and stylish cabinet that’s easy to transport. But when you invest in this range-topping model, you’re getting an instrument that represents the pinnacle of Roland’s acclaimed piano technology. From the addictively playable PHA-50 hybrid keyboard and PureAcoustic Piano Modeling from our premium pianos, to custom tone shaping and deep sound immersion from the onboard speaker system, the FP-90X delivers the ultimate FP-X experience.

\r\n\r\n
Roland’s finest acoustic pianos, customizable for your touch
\r\n
While all FP-X series pianos provide highly authentic tone, the FP-90X goes beyond. With astonishing accuracy, Roland’s PureAcoustic Piano Modeling sound engine reproduces every aspect of how the rich, resonant sound of an acoustic grand piano is created. Choose from elegant Concert and dynamic Stage pianos via eight ready-to-play variations. Then dive deeper with the onboard Piano Designer, personalizing the sound like a piano technician through a range of easy-to-adjust parameters. And with My Stage and PureAcoustic Ambience, you can instantly immerse yourself in a variety of realistic environments, from studios to concert halls. The FP-90X’s piano tones are almost infinite—and each is the best in its class.

\r\n\r\n
Dive into immersive sound with the powerful four-speaker system.
\r\n
With a high-fidelity onboard sound system that projects your music from every angle, no other FP-X series piano can match the sonic depth and wide dynamic range of the FP-90X. A pair of powerful woofers and twin dome tweeters work in harmony with special vents in the cabinet’s back, producing a deep sound field that fully envelops the playing position. In addition to home playing, this full-range system makes the FP-90X a powerful and flexible choice for intimate live performances. And just as important for private practice is the Headphones Acoustic Projection feature, giving you that same thrill of immersion with tone that seems to fill the room—even when nobody else can hear it.

\r\n\r\n\r\n
All the feel of an acoustic grand, without the maintenance.
\r\n
The FP-90X’s PHA-50 keyboard—also found in Roland’s top-level home pianos—is an innovative hybrid that gives you the best of both worlds, combining the feel and texture of acoustic piano keys with unbeatable durability. The warm touch of the wood sides will be instantly familiar to seasoned players, while the composite center frame extends from the front of the keys to the back for a stable, assured touch. A crafted hammer action mechanism ensures authentic response, while the look and feel of ivory and ebony are reproduced in minute detail. It’s just like playing a traditional acoustic grand—minus the regular maintenance.

\r\n\r\n
Heavyweight features in a portable format.
\r\n
The FP-90X fuses its powerful features into a stylish format that works for modern musicians at home or on the move. With compact dimensions and surprisingly light weight for a hammer-action instrument, it shifts easily around your living space and stores easily in a closet or vehicle. You can supplement your FP-90X by adding a KSC-90 stand and KPD-90 three-pedal unit for a traditional upright experience, or with the portable KS-20X stand and RPU-3 pedal unit for gigging.

\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
Enhance your music making with Bluetooth and USB.
\r\n
The FP-90X’s best-in-class piano features are just the start. Via Bluetooth audio, you can stream music from a phone or tablet through the piano’s sound system and jam along. And with Bluetooth MIDI, you’re able to connect with fun music composition apps like Roland’s Zenbeats or Apple’s GarageBand. If you like to sing, connect a microphone, add effects, and amplify your vocals through the speakers, and capture them along with your piano playing using the onboard recorder. The FP-90X even features USB audio/MIDI connectivity, allowing you to interface with computers and record tracks in professional music production software.

\r\n
Two distinct concert grand piano sounds

\r\n
XE20’s German Piano is sourced from one of the most famous pianos makers in \r\nthe world; beloved by numerous pianists for its versatile expressive power. It \r\nis distinctive for its bold tonality together with a brilliant high register and \r\nnuanced low range. The Italian Piano is also famous world-wide for its rich \r\nresonances and sensitivity to players’ styles. These two sounds will give you a \r\nnuanced choice to help you get the most out of your playing experience.

\r\n
Perform with an extensive variety of sounds

\r\n
In addition to its stunning pianos, the XE20 provides a versatile collection \r\nof more than 700 expressive and authentic sounds, including electric pianos, \r\norgans, synth pads, brass, strings, drum kits, and much more, all sampled from \r\nactual acoustic and digital instruments. Each of these realistic sounds can be \r\nplayed live or used as part of XE20’s automatic accompaniments.

\r\n
Automatic accompaniments take your performances further

\r\n
XE20 is equipped with an automatic accompaniment function called \"Styles,\" \r\nwhich lets you automatically produce a full backing band simply by playing one \r\nfinger or a chord in the left hand. This accompaniment will change according to \r\nthe keyboard location or chord that you play, making it easy to create simple \r\nimprovisations just by using your right hand to play a melody along with the \r\naccompaniment. More than 280 different styles are provided for musical genres \r\nfrom around the world, and each style includes four variations ranging from \r\nsimple to complex, plus an intro and an ending for the beginning and end of the \r\nsong.

And, since the XE20 has the same \r\n88-note keyboard as a grand piano, you can enjoy duets with a family member or \r\nfriend.

\r\n
Perform your favorite songs with the XE20

\r\n
Once you're comfortable playing a song, you can record your own performance \r\non the XE20 and save it for later. In addition to your own songs, you can use \r\nthe Song Mode to play back on board demo songs, MP3 or WAV audio data, or \r\nStandard MIDI Files from any commercially available USB flash drive, while you \r\nperform along with the playback.

\r\n
Slim design that fits in anywhere

\r\n
The XE20 is just 34 cm deep and weighs only 11.4 kg (*not including the music \r\nrest and the separately sold stand). Its versatile functions are centrally \r\nlocated on a convenient front panel, giving it the same compact style as a \r\ntypical digital piano with additional accompaniment and customization.

\r\n
Powered-up speakers for powerful playback

\r\n
XE20’s speakers have been redesigned to provide plenty of power and clarity \r\nas well. This new playback system also improves the overall balance, so that \r\neven when automatic accompaniment is enabled, the low frequencies of the drums \r\nand bass will be present while allowing the piano to shine through.

\r\n
A keyboard with the touch of an acoustic piano

\r\n
The XE20 features a graded weighted hammer action keyboard to provide a true \r\nacoustic piano fee; lower keys feel heavier and get lighter as you play upward. \r\nThe keyboard is finely balanced, providing a natural, effortless playing \r\nexperience.
Huge bundle of convenient software for practicing and creativity. \r\nThe XE20 is bundled with software including Skoove’s award-winning piano \r\nteaching software to help you improve your playing, along with Korg’s Module \r\napp, which provides access to even more sounds, and finally Korg’s Gadget 2 Le \r\nDAW music production app.

This premium “one-up, one-down” kit features wood shells with full depth and diameter, covered with attractive wraps and mounted on double-braced chrome stands. Roland’s advanced digital sensor technology and dynamic TD-27 drum module provide the sound and response to match, with every stroke, ghost note, roll, and swell expressed in incredible detail.

\r\n\r\n
Building on the previous VAD503 model, the VAD504 adds a digital hi-hat for even greater expression, plus heavy-duty cymbal stands inherited from the flagship VAD706. The TD-27 module has also been updated, bringing you new kits and samples, expanded processing options, Roland Cloud support, and more.

An Immersive Acoustic Drumming Experience
\r\n
With the impressive looks, familiar layout, and inspiring playability of a high-end acoustic kit, the VAD504 makes any drummer feel instantly at home. There’s a 14-inch stainless steel snare, 10-inch rack tom, 14-inch floor tom, and 20-inch kick constructed with full-depth wood shells, adding to the authenticity and providing genuine acoustic feel under the sticks and beater. A full complement of cymbals includes a 14-inch V-Hi-Hat, 14-inch crash (with thin profile and textured finish), and an 18-inch ride for superior playability and natural appearance on stage.

\r\n\r\n
Digital Snare, Ride, and Hi-Hat
\r\n
Roland’s groundbreaking digital pad technology is a major leap forward in electronic drumming, putting unmatched depth and dimension under your sticks. Precision multi-sensors in the snare, ride, and hi-hat pads work in harmony with the TD-27 module to capture every nuance with incredible definition and detail. Lightning-fast detection lets you play all your natural acoustic techniques, such as muting the ride with a finger touch or switching seamlessly between head, rimshot, and cross stick playing on the snare. And the VH-14D takes the electronic hi-hat to new heights with unparalleled touch sensitivity, tonal variation, and open/closed resolution.

\r\n\r\n
The Natural Feel of Acoustic Drums
\r\n
Roland’s legendary multi-ply, tension-adjustable mesh heads contribute significantly to the authentic playing feel, giving you stick rebound that’s customizable for your playing style. And when you bury the beater into the specially designed kick drum, you physically move air inside the shell, creating air pressure and resistance that feels remarkably like playing an acoustic kick.

\r\n\r\n
Go Deeper with Prismatic Sound Modeling
\r\n
Derived from the flagship TD-50X, the TD-27 sound module is filled with drums that live and breathe like acoustic instruments. We start by sampling the finest drums, percussion, and cymbals—both vintage and modern—in world-class recording studios. Roland’s unique Prismatic Sound Modeling is then applied to the samples, bringing them alive with proprietary behavior modeling refined over two decades. Every time you strike a drum or cymbal, you’re not simply triggering a canned sound—you’re playing a full-bodied instrument that responds like its acoustic counterpart in every way, putting unprecedented sonic range at your command.

\r\n\r\n
TD-27 Module: More Sounds, More Power
\r\n
The updated TD-27 module features 75 preset kits, including 10 all-new kits and newly enhanced versions of the three most popular kits from the original release. New pre-loaded samples are available for combining with preset kits or your own custom setups. Layering features have been expanded, while parallel compression options and transient shaping enhancements provide even greater sound control. The module interface has also been improved for faster sound creation. And with support for Roland Cloud content, you can expand your playing experience with a growing selection of sounds, samples, and custom kits from top V-Drums artists.

\r\n\r\n
Create (and Craft) Your Signature Drum Kit
\r\n
With acoustic drums, you make the sound your own by swapping head types, adjusting the tuning, applying damping, tweaking the snare wire tension, changing the kick beater, and more. This is all possible with the TD-27 module, allowing you to craft customized kits for any situation. Just strike a pad to select it and use the hands-on controls and intuitive editing tools to get the sound just how you like it. Your edits are saved automatically too, so you always stay focused on playing. It’s even possible to load your own samples and layer them with the internal sounds to personalize kits even more.

\r\n\r\n
Double-Braced Chrome Drum Stands
\r\n
The VAD504 comes equipped with the same heavy-duty stands as the flagship VAD706, delivering high-end performance and genuine acoustic feel. The tom pads mount just like acoustic toms—so they feel just right when they’re hit. Newly developed thin V-Cymbals attach with a special pivot mount for natural acoustic swing and stick feel. And every stand is double braced for rock-solid stability and easily adjusted to suit your preferred layout.

\r\n\r\n
Advanced Sound Processing Options
\r\n
Use PureAcoustic Ambience Technology to create an incredibly natural and immersive sound field when playing. And go deeper by adjusting individual drums mics and the stereo overheads, just as you would with an acoustic kit. Advanced onboard multi-effects and mixing capabilities give you the power of a full-scale studio console, with transient processing, parametric EQs, compressors, reverbs, delays, and more at your command.

\r\n\r\n
Powerful Connectivity for Stage and Studio
\r\n
The VAD504 delivers fantastic sound for live performance or recording, thanks to a wealth of connectivity options. The TD-27 module features stereo outputs for the overall drum sound, plus two direct outputs for sending kick, snare, and other sounds to an audio console for independent mixing. In the studio, the built-in USB audio interface makes computer music production easy, with up to 28 audio channels available over a single cable. MIDI is also supported via USB and dedicated I/O, allowing you to sync with other MIDI devices and trigger sounds in computer software.

\r\n\r\n
Kit Expansion Made Easy
\r\n
With the VAD504, you’re not stuck with a static setup. Using the TD-27 module’s three auxiliary trigger inputs, it’s easy to add tom and cymbal pads to bolster your arsenal. Or you may go for maximum impact with an imposing double-kick setup. Whatever you’re thinking, the auxiliary trigger inputs are the gateway to your ideal drum setup.

\r\n\r\n
Bluetooth Audio Streaming
\r\n
Built-in Bluetooth lets you wirelessly stream audio from a phone or laptop to the module—ideal for jamming with headphones. Play along with backing tracks and your favorite bands, or mix the sound from a YouTube lesson video with the kit. You can even record your performances—with or without backing—to hear where you need to tighten things up.

\r\n\r\n
Your Personal Onboard Drum Coach
\r\n
Coach mode supports your daily practice sessions, complete with progress tracking that makes learning effective and rewarding. Play through warm-ups, develop your sense of groove, tempo, and timing, and even work on your stamina—all with a score that highlights your progress and motivates you to improve.

Yamaha DTX8K-M E-Drum Set
\r\n\r\n
The DTX8K-M defines the new upper mid-range of the Yamaha E-Drums range but uses Yamaha's new mesh head pads. It promises professional sounds and features for players of all levels, and offers a massive technological step forward. It combines Yamaha's world class acoustic drum history with the newest in digital drumming, sampling, and music technology.

\r\n\r\n
The mesh head drum pads use real Yamaha birch drum shells for a totally authentic look and maximum drumming integrity, finished in two of the same beautiful sprayed finishes as Yamaha's acoustic drums – Black Forest and Real Wood. The lugs and hoops are the same as on Yamaha's acoustic drums, and each pad features a unique 'DTX Drums' badge.

\r\n\r\n
The DTX-PRO Drum Trigger Module offers totally new audio quality with new samples recorded in some of the best studios in Europe. The sounds can be treated with a host of studio effects, so users can tailor the sound of their kits to their exact needs. Users can also load up to 1000 of their own samples, in addition to the 400+ internal sounds.

\r\n\r\n
Unique to the DTX-PRO Modules are the Kit Modifier Knobs which allow the user to instantly change the sound of the kit by adjusting real sampled room ambience (not just digital reverb), kit compression, and other effects in real time. Every channel also has EQ, and Transient Adjustment which is usually found in studio software and allows you to change the attack and decay of the sound to suit your needs.

Noise is the biggest challenge that drummers and aspiring drummers face. Drumming is inherently loud, and not loved by everyone. Electronic drums help mitigate the noise problem, but they are not completely silent. Roland V-Drums are quieter than other electronic kits, but even their pad strikes and pedal thumps can still be heard in many settings.

\n
V-Drums Quiet Design (VQD) offer a unique solution, reducing drumming noise by up to 75% through innovative designs and materials. This allows drummers to play at times and places that would normally be off-limits due to noise concerns. VQD gives drummers the freedom to play whenever and wherever they want.

Genuine V-Drums Performance
\r\n
Over two-plus decades, Roland V-Drums have established a well-earned reputation as the most realistic, best playing, and best sounding electronic drums available, bar none. Laying the path for all electronic drums sets that have followed, V-Drums are often imitated, but never equaled or bettered. The TD-07KV fully embodies this proud legacy, bringing you the finest electronic drumming experience available in its class.

\r\n\r\n
Exceptional Sound
\r\n
The heart of any great electronic drum set is a powerful, capable, and speedy sound module—and the TD-07 fully meets these demands. At your command are acoustic drums and percussion captured in precise detail in pro studios, brought to life with advanced V-Drums technologies that make them behave just like their acoustic counterparts as you play them. There’s a wide range of electronic percussion as well, plus the ability to personalize each and every sound to your liking.

\r\n\r\n
Play Right Away—or Dive Deeper
\r\n
The TD-07 is filled with inspiring, ready-to-play preset kits for instant gratification right out of the box. And when you’re ready for deeper exploration, a massive drum library awaits. Switch out one snare for another, mix up the toms, go large on the kick drum, and swap heavy for light crashes and rides. Then tune the drums, add damping, and change the ambient environment at will. For the finishing touch, use the module’s individual EQs to shape the drums to perfection—just as a pro sound engineer would do.

\r\n\r\n
Truly Quiet Drums
\r\n
One of the main advantages of choosing electronic drums for home playing is that they’re much quieter than acoustic drums. But not all electronic kits are created equal, and the amount of physical noise they generate can vary greatly. Backed by decades of R&D, the TD-07KV is purpose-designed to be much quieter than other e-kits. Mesh heads minimize pad noise without compromising stick rebound, and special damping in the kick pad reduces noise and vibration while retaining a satisfying, natural feel. Even the stand components are designed to reduce vibration and noise transfer to the floor, and Roland offers a range of optional solutions to further reduce noise if needed.

\r\n\r\n
Real Acoustic Sound and Response
\r\n\r\n
While some electronic kits promise “acoustic sound,” they actually just offer static drum tones that are triggered at varying levels, depending on how hard the pads are played. In stark contrast, V-Drums produce a rich array of tone colors, providing an inspiring musical experience that feels like playing acoustic drums. Thanks to advanced precision sensors, the TD-07KV’s drum and cymbal pads detect every hit, stoke, roll, flam, and ghost note perfectly, and even cymbal chokes can be performed organically. Faster than you can blink, this information is processed by the sound module so that that exact correct tone is heard. You won’t notice any of this technology at work—but when you close your eyes and start drumming with the TD-07KV, you’ll know that it feels just right.

\r\n\r\n
Authentic Roland Mesh-Head Pads
\r\n
In 1997, Roland introduced the world’s first mesh drumhead to universal acclaim, and they’ve been the de facto standard ever since. Born of years of development, our unique double-layer mesh design offers natural stick resistance and rebound that feels very close to playing an acoustic drumhead, plus adjustable tension that lets you fine-tune the feel using a standard drum key. Single-ply mesh heads used on other electronic drums are not made of the same material, so they don’t feel as good to play. They can also provide less accurate sensing, resulting in poor dynamic response and mis-triggering. The TD-07KV comes supplied with authentic Roland mesh-head snare and tom pads as standard, giving you the most accurate playing feel and sensing available.

\r\n\r\n
Strong and Stable Hardware
\r\n
When you’re drumming in full swing, there’s nothing more frustrating than a stand that feels unstable or a drum that starts to move away as you play it. Built with strong materials and quality components, the TD-07KV’s hardware delivers the rock-solid stability you need. The custom drum stand provides a firm, steady foundation, while precision clamps tightly hold all components in place. Carrying on the rugged durability that V-Drums are famous for, the TD-07KV is ready to stand up to years of heavy playing, day after day.

\r\n\r\n
Play Along with Music Over Bluetooth
\r\n
Drumming with favorite tracks is one of the most fun and productive things you can do with an electronic kit, and the TD-07KV makes it easy. Thanks to onboard Bluetooth, you can call up tracks on your smartphone, tablet, or computer and wirelessly hear the audio through the module right alongside the drums. Video sound is transmitted too, perfect for playing along with online songs and lesson content. And if you don’t have a Bluetooth device, you can bring in stereo sound with a cable. MIDI transmission over Bluetooth is also supported, allowing you to record MIDI data in music apps cable-free.

\r\n\r\n
Connectivity with Music Software via USB
\r\n
A huge benefit of electronic drums is direct communication with modern music production software. The TD-07 module is an audio/MIDI recording interface in itself, with the ability to send stereo sound and multi-channel MIDI data to a Mac or Windows computer via a single USB cable. This lets you record discrete audio and MIDI drum tracks in any DAW, or trigger sounds in software-based drum instruments for studio or live playing.

The Strata Core is a pro level e-kit that punches above its weight class rivaling alternative drum sets with higher prices and bigger footprints. Experience exceptional sound quality and realistic playability in this powerful yet compact addition to the Strata line.

\n
Every detail of the Alesis Strata Core has been designed to deliver a responsive and natural experience for intermediate and experienced drummers. The all mesh Strata drumheads have adjustable tension, the 360-degree ARC cymbals are free to move and respond like acoustic cymbals would, and the Active Magnetic hi-hat ensures crisp precision and accuracy.

\n
The Core’s drum sizes conserve much-needed space in a studio setup without compromising on playability. The dual zone mesh toms offer a realistic feel, with ample mounting options thanks to the curved steel rack with reinforced mounts. The 12” dual-zone mesh snare drum and 12” hi-hat offer a superbly familiar response when playing. Paired with the 8” mesh kick, you’ll immediately feel comfortable playing single or double kick pedals.

\n
Drums

\n
A dual-zone snare drum with independent sounds triggered on the head, rim click, and rim shot, followed by 8”/8”/10” toms and an 8” kick drum provides ample playing surface, suitable for all varieties of single and double kick drum pedals. The tension can be adjusted on all mesh heads, letting you set the exact level of rebound and expressiveness to your preference. Unnatural and unwanted ‘hotspots’ on the heads are eliminated with our unique patented anti-hotspot sensor design (U.S. Patent 9,424,827).

\n
ARC Cymbals

\n
Strata Core’s ARC cymbals are exceptionally sensitive with a beautifully lathed surface. All three cymbals - the 14” ride and two 12” crashes - are triple-zone with different sounds triggered on the bell, bow, and edge of each cymbal. They’re all 360-degree responsive, so that you can play anywhere throughout the cymbal and mount on standard acoustic arm mounts, which allows them to respond and swing naturally without restrictions. All cymbals have dual-edge sensors (patent pending) and profiles that allow incredible expressiveness without having to adjust your technique.

\n
Hi-Hat

\n
The 12” Active Magnetic hi-hat is a superbly playable magnetic, stand-mounted system. Like the cymbals, this triple-zone 360-degree playing surface is extremely responsive. Magnetic position sensing ensures that pedal movements are translated in high resolution, meaning the contactless system is unmatched in its accuracy. This module-powered unit can be used with a wide variety of hi-hat stands and playing techniques.

\n
Hardware

\n
The backbone of Strata Core is a curved steel rack where the toms, cymbals and module are mounted. Sturdy but flexible, it allows for spacious and compact footprints so you can adjust the kit to your ideal playing position for your setup. The ARC hi-hats mount to any hi-hat stand, and the 8\" kick tower can accommodate any single or double pedal configuration. Crash and ride cymbals can be mounted to standard acoustic cymbal stands and are not bound to the rack mounts.

\n
Module

\n
The heart of the Strata Core is a powerful drum module featuring a 7” touchscreen display and a powerful BFD sound engine running on a multi-core processor. With over 25GB of content, across 75 kits, 370+ kit pieces, 800+ articulations, and 144,000+ samples with multiple adjustable microphone channels you’ll find what’s right for you. The customizable trigger engine supports all modern E-kit triggers. Experiment with a “stacks” function for layering articulations and mixing individual microphones. Control options include rotary encoders, separate volume knobs, and Bluetooth 5.0 streaming. Jam creatively with a variety of trigger inputs, MIDI connectivity, and USB storage for sample imports.
